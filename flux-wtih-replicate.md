## Required Environment Variables

Make sure the following environment variable is set:
```bash
export REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=
Install Replicate

Install the Replicate package:


pip install replicate


1. Create a Replicate Client
Create a file named replicate_client.py in your projectâ€™s library folder (/lib):

# Create the Replicate client
import os
import replicate


replicate_client = replicate.Client(api_token=os.getenv("REPLICATE_API_TOKEN"))


#2. Create a Server Action
Create a new file named replicate_actions.py in the actions directory (/actions):


from replicate_client import replicate_client

async def generate_flux_image(prompt: str):
    input_params = {
        "prompt": prompt,
        "num_outputs": 1,
        "aspect_ratio": "1:1",
        "output_format": "webp",
        "output_quality": 80,
    }

    output = replicate_client.run(
        "black-forest-labs/flux-schnell", input=input_params
    )
    
    return output


#3. Run the Action
To use the generate_flux_image function, import and call it in your code like this:


import asyncio
from actions.replicate_actions import generate_flux_image

# Example usage
async def main():
    prompt = "A futuristic cityscape"
    output = await generate_flux_image(prompt)
    print(output)

asyncio.run(main())
